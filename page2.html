                  Instead of utilizing small teams of software developers to create improved utilities to accompany 
                  Windows 3.0, Microsoft hired individual software developers that already had successful programs; 
                  they used limited versions of their programming and code for the next installment of MS Paint. 
                  Since 1985, ZSoft had had its own 16-color paint program coded by Mark Zachmann called PC Paintbrush.
                  <span class="italic">Microsoft Paintbrush</span> replaced Windows Paint in 1990 as a part of Windows 3.0, offering a new 
                   and improved UI (user interface) and true color matching. It used BMP and PCX file formats for 
                   saving images. Because it took its programming base from PC Paintbrush, <span class="italic">Microsoft Paintbrush</span> 
                   was technically more related to PC Paintbrush than to Windows Paint, but it still had the 
                   same essential functions of digital painting software. The tool selection menu now sits on the 
                   very left edge of the computer screen, with the color palette spanning across the bottom of 
                   the screen. While the pencil tool was gotten rid of, the brush tool stayed on the menu, and 
                   the paint can became a paint roller. The number of shape tools decreased from 12 to 8. The most 
                   important feature of this new MS Paint version is color. Those producing images with <span class="italic">Microsoft Paintbrush</span> 
                   no longer needed to limit themselves to black and white illustrations. Users could now create 
                   images with a variety of different hues, made using a color mixer tool and combining 256 values 
                   each of red, green, and blue.
